This is the ERIC VM from Vulnhub.

Description from the author:

    Flags
        /root/flag.txt
        /home/eric/flag.txt
    Tested with VirtualBox
    DHCP
    Difficulty: Beginner/Intermediate

The machines are in the intermediate difficulty range. None of them should be as easy as to just run a msf module to get root right away, if so please let me know. They all have two flags, one for local and one for root access.

Doesn't always get an IP address nicely with DHCP.
